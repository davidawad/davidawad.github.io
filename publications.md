I've given talks and written articles and notes on all kinds of topics from bitcoin, maxwell's equations and neural networks to how to get a job in tech, run great teams and inspire action. Not to mention my book! (*cough*) On this page you'll find slides, videos, and additional information on some of the talks, lectures, and other content I've written. Feel free to write to me if you have any questions.

### The Life of a Professional
#### 100 Life Pro-Tips by David Awad

![](/public/img/book_cover.png)

This book is a collection of tips, tricks, and jokes that I wrote over the span of my college years— a very formative time in my life, indeed. While going through this time, I took notes on experiences that have really stuck with me. It contains lessons I’ve learned in trying to live my own life. Each of these “pro-tips” contains some commentary from myself that provides additional discussion or context on how that pro-tip came to be. They will probably come across as streams of consciousness, segments of jokes, barside storytelling, and very rare glimmers of poetic insight.

> And just for being awesome and taking an interest in the stuff I've written, I'll share an [embarassing secret](/public/Harmony-DavidAwad.pdf). This is a link to a short children's book I've written and published. For some reason I gave it a really sophisticated name. Please try not to laugh at it too much.
