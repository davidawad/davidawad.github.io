### Introducing the Contract Variable Highlighter: A Game-Changer for Contract Lawyers

In the fast-paced legal industry, efficiency and precision are paramount. That's why I'm excited to launch **Contract  Highlighter**, a Google Workspace Add-on designed for contract lawyers who work extensively with Google Docs.

#### Streamline Your Contract Editing Process

Contracts often contain numerous variables—such as names, dates, and specific terms—that need to be customized for each client. Manually searching for these variables can be time-consuming and error-prone.

Our add-on automatically highlights all the variables in your document, making it easy to spot what needs to be edited. You can even configure variables using regular expressions (regex), allowing for advanced customization tailored to your specific needs.
