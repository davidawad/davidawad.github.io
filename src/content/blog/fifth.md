A quick explanation of the fifth amendment:

Timmy stole Sally's doll. Now Timmy is in front of the classroom, defending his innocence.

Now the teacher calls on you. She knows that you saw everything that happened. And you tell the truth because you have these weird feelings for Sally and maybe you'll give her half of your cookie later.

But wait! The teacher also asks what YOU were doing at the time. Ah, now you remember, you were sitting on the bench eating glue. Nice. That's against the rules, but you don't want to get in trouble. Luckily, eating glue has nothing to do with the theft of Sally's doll. So you tell your teacher that you 'plead the fifth'.

Later, another student might tell the teacher that you were eating glue. But maybe not. Either way, you weren't the one that got yourself in trouble. Sucks to be Timmy.
