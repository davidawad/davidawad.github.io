I put together a post on technical due diligence that was co-Authored with the wonderful folks at GoingVC Partners.

It contains a whole lot of information on how to evaluate a technical company that you're thinking of acquiring and a framework for thinking about them longer term and whether they can do what they set out to do.

Feel free to find the post on the GVC website [here](https://www.goingvc.com/venture-capital-due-diligence-technical-due-diligence/).
