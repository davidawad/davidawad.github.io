## My recommended readings.

The books I've listed here are some of the most useful and eye-opening that I've gone through. I've read everything on this list and won't add anything here unless I've read it myself.

The lists are in the order they I would read them if _starting from scratch_.

If you have books that you think I should read or add to this list, feel free to let me know!

## General

This is my general recommended reading list for pretty much anyone.

- Lying by Sam Harris
- Principles by Ray Dalio
- 1984 by George Orwell
- Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt
- The Quest for Cosmic Justice by Thomas Sowell
- The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion by Jonathan Haidt
- The Apology by Plato

## Computing

> I think every programmer should read these books, they are each so great and so important.
> They will take you from building a computer from the ground up,
> to writing clean maintainable code, designing it well, and then making it efficient.
> You then go on to start thinking about the kinds of problems that computers can actually solve, and what the limits are.

- CODE by Charles Petzold
- Code Complete 2 by Steve McConnell
- Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by John Vlissides, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and Erich Gamma
- The Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd Ed. by Steven Skiena
- Quantum Computing Since Democritus by Scott Aaronson

#### Others good Computing Books

- Debugging by David J. Agans
- The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen
- Team Geek by Brian Fitzpatrick and Ben Sussman

#### Papers

#### Articles

- [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way by Eric Steven Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

  > the most important article you can find about asking questions in the field of technology.

- [How to become Hacker by Eric Steven Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)

- [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years by Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)

#### Web Resources

Especially in Computing, there are a few great web resources that are worth taking a look through.

- [Udacity Georgia Tech Advanced OS Prep Course Networking Section Quizzes](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud098/lessons/661559564/concepts/6859487040923)

This course by UAlberta on Design Patterns is really helpful for understanding how to structure clean software, and you should take it before you write code for anyone.

- [Design Patterns](https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-patterns)

#### Computing Online Courses

- [Design Patterns](https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-patterns)

  > This is a GREAT course if you've never really done (or been forced to do) proper object oriented programming before
  > Lots of widely used terms and an understanding of good design patterns is great.

- [Software Architecture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-patterns) and [Service Oriented Architecture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/service-oriented-architecture)

  > Not terribly useful if you already have some experience but it filled a few gaps in my knowledge

- [Nand to Tetris]()

## Physics

> it's really hard to find physics books that don't feel like they're going over the same concepts again and again.

- Quantum Mechanics for Dummies, which is to say, a simple introduction to quantum mechanics from the wiley 'for dummies' series
- Six Easy Pieces by Richard Feynman
- Six Not So Easy Pieces by Richard Feynman
- QED by Richard Feynman
- A Brief History of Time by Steven Hawking

## Philosophy

There is so much great work in philosophy, these are my picks that I've enjoyed.

- The Apology by Plato
- The Republic by Plato
- The Practicing Stoic: A Philosophical User's Manual by Ward Farnsworth
- Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
- Free Will by Sam Harris
- Atheism for Dummies, which is to say, a simple introduction to atheism from the wiley 'for dummies' series

If you're up for a serious challenge, try Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietchze.

## Literature & Fiction

> I am incredibly divided on the value of fiction.
> I think good fiction tells you something about reality but at the same time
> I get more value faster from just reading the articles.

- Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain
- Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain
- 11/22/63 by Stephen King

## Extras

These are books that I thought were really interesting, a good learning experience, or just a fun read.

- On Liberty by John Stuart Mill, specifically chapter 2. Some of the best arguments on free speech ever written.
- Improvise by Mick Napier
- The Enchiridion by Epictetus
  > It reads sort of like a set of lessons that Epictetus put together. There are certain points where it feels more like an instagram post then greek philosophy, but hey.
- The Indisputable Existence of Santa Claus
  > Hannah Fry attempts to use fun math puzzles to trick us into believing that Santa Claus exists. The "proofs" are a fun read nontheless.
- The United States of Absurdity by Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds
  > just a hilarious book with great illustration.
- A People's History of the Supreme Court by Peter Irons
  > It's super long but it will go through all of the landmark cases that the courts have faced and really was interesting to read. A little more preachy than I'd like however.
- Born a Crime by Trevor Noah
  > it's a surprisingly fun book. Trevor's endearing voice finds a fun way to tell you stories all about South africa and what his life was like. While the cover says it's about his life, the book seems to really be a beautiful testament to his mother.
- Gaming the Vote: Why Elections Aren't Fair by William Poundstone\*
  > Before you get start attacking me, this is a book about the _mathematics of voting systems_ and how they can be improved upon.
- The Euthyphro by Plato
  > This is just the classic socratic method. Such a fun little read if you get the right translation.
- The Federalist Papers by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay
  > In the federalist papers I recommend specifically: `[10, 28, 29, 71, 78, 79, 80, 81]`. Those are the most important ones.
- Classical English Rhetoric by Ward Farnsworth
  > A very interesting coffee table piece, it contains rhetorical devices used all throughout english literature. Very cool to read through.

## MOOCS

> These are the MOOC's I've taken that I think are worth going through.
> Feel free to pick and choose, I recommend everything here.

- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)

  > Completely changed how I thought about the process of learning, and gave me an informed way to measure the quality of my learning and change my techniques for studying new information.

- [Understanding the Brain: The Neurobiology of Everyday Life](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neurobiology)

- [Introduction to American Law](https://www.coursera.org/learn/american-law)

  > Really important overview of the basics of a few different types of law. Everyone should take this course.

- [Introduction to Key Constitutional Concepts and Supreme Court Cases](https://www.coursera.org/learn/constitution)

  > I found it interesting, and a fun overview of the history.

- [Introduction to Marketing from Wharton](https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-marketing/home/welcome)
  > Super interesting introduction to the level of details that marketing professionals think about.

## My Books

> I would be remiss if I didn't mention my own ridiculous book, [The Life of a Professional, 100 Life Pro-Tips by David Awad](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Professional-100-Pro-Tips/dp/1973137364/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=david+awad&qid=1581092788&sr=8-1).
