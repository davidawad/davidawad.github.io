## An Open Letter

Hi there, I'm David.

If you're reading this, you've taken the time to read my website. Thanks! I'll try to keep it brief.

I'm an Egyptian American from Central Jersey. Growing up, I got in fights, skipped classes, and wasn't that smart, but I called out bullies, supported my friends, and loved having fun. I started college for musical theater but quickly switched to a double in computer science and physics (It turns out I hated actors). I worked with big tech companies until 2016, when I left that behind to start a nonprofit with my friends John and Kelsey. I didn't know how to file articles of incorporation, but I could hand out McChickens off the hood of my Nissan. But it turned out the "non" in nonprofit was literal, so I took a job writing software while doing grad school.

I spend any free time I have just having fun. That can be anything from field equations, water balloons, game theory, lego machines, writing jokes, and fighting traffic tickets. I'll be the first to tell you that I have had (and built) some stupid ideas. But I'm incredibly fortunate to have learned and grown with so many amazing friends over my short life.

As I get older, the new problems look the same as when I was a kid. I still get in fights, I still call out bullies, I still support my friends, and I love having fun. I believe in objective truth, personal responsibility, individual liberty, and technology's power to create a free and just society. The world is full of these fascinating puzzles, and I want to help solve them.

If we can help each other, please reach out. I'm no Socrates, but at least I want to be.

Sending my best,

## Personality Details

Now if you're actually reading this about page to learn something more about me you can take a look at this series of psychometric indicators I've tested for.

### Meyers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)

The MBTI is a widely known personality indicator, there's more to read about it [here](https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types).

#### Team Dimensions Profile (DiSC)

The [DiSC model](https://www.discprofile.com/what-is-disc/overview/) provides a common language that people can use to better understand themselves and to adapt their behaviors with others â€” within a work team, a sales relationship, a leadership position, or other relationships.

It breaks this down among four general categories:

- influence
- dominance
- compliance
- steadiness

##### According to DiSC

![my DiSC test results](/assets/img/personality_tests/disc.png)

> You are socially oriented.
>
> You have a strong self-motivation to get to know people in all walks of life and to nurture those relationships. You have a natural enthusiasm for all types of ideas and projects - your own and other people's. People are likely to describe you as gregarious, persuasive and optimistic.

#### Big Five Personality Test ([IPIP-BFFM](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/))

![my BIG 5 test results](/assets/img/personality_tests/BIG5-graphic.png)

Factor I is labelled as Extroversion by the developers of the IPIP-BFFM. Factor I is sometimes given other names, such as Surgency or Positive Emotionality.
Individuals who score high on Factor I one are outgoing and social. Individuals who score low tend to be shut ins.

Factor II is labeled as Emotional Stability. Factor II is often referred to by other names, such as Neruoticism or Negative Emotionality (in these two cases interpretations are inverted, as Neruoticism and Negative Emotionality can be though of as the opposite of Emotional Stability).

Factor III is labeled as Agreeableness. A person high in agreeableness is friendly and optimistic. Low scorers are critical and aggressive.

Factor IV is labeled as Conscientiousness. Individuals who score high on this factor are careful and diligent. Low scorers are impulsive and disorganized.

Factor V is labeled as Intellect/Imagination. This factor is also often called Openness to Experience. Low scorers tend to be traditional and conventional.
